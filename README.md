# Basic Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a basic implementation of linear regression. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python and popular data science libraries.

## 🏗 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing
- Implementation of Linear Regression using Scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using metrics like MSE and R-squared
- Visualization of regression results

## 📂 Files
- **Basic Linear Regression.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation.

## 🛠 Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
