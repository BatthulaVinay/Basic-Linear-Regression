# Basic Linear Regression

## Overview
This project demonstrates **Basic Linear Regression** using Python. The notebook includes dataset loading, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Training a Linear Regression Model
- Model Evaluation
- Data Visualization

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 300 samples with two columns:
- `X`: Independent variable (integer values)
- `Y`: Dependent variable (float values, following a linear trend with some noise)

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
jupyter notebook "Basic Linear Regression.ipynb"
```

## Results
- The model fits a linear function to the data.
- The regression line is plotted against actual data.
- Predictions and residual analysis help assess the model's accuracy.

## Visualization
The notebook generates a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values and displays the fitted regression line.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and improve the implementation. Pull requests are welcome!
